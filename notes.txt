plan 

1. insert the fonts and try it out, settle this first
2. work on the sidebar -> create components folder and add the components in?
3. coming soon...

thought processes while i work on this 
- added fonts, quite easy. referred to youtube and other resources on google
- now time to properly structure the basic project structure
    - create the folders/files first, code later
